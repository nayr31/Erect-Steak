# Erect Steak

The name of this project is a joke that relates to the H3VR (a game about shooting hotdogs) character "Flaccid Steak".

The changes this character brings:

- Start with a decoy mag (stealth) or a knife (lethal)
- All static guns and grenades are now pools related to what they were before
- Stinger has been changed to a general rocket launcher pool with reduced cost (3 instead of 4, like the controllable launcher)

## Changelog

### 1.0.4

Fixed decoy mag spawning with revolvers

### 1.0.3

- Removed the recycler from the first take phase.
- Changed the always spawning box to either spawn a decoy magazine or a combat knife.
  - The reason behind this change was the overall utility and performance of the box.
  - This also gives some more role-play elements, either lethal or a more stealth approach (you can still knock sosigs out with a magazine, so non-lethal as well).
- Now depends on [OtherLoader](https://h3vr.thunderstore.io/package/devyndamonster/OtherLoader/)

### 1.0.2

- Box now spawns with starting equipment.
- Reduced starting points by 1.

### 1.0.1

Changed suppressor token cost (4 -> 2).

### 1.0.0

Initial Release.

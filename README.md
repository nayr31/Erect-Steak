# Erect Steak

The name of this project is a joke that relates to the H3VR (a game about shooting hotdogs) character "Flaccid Steak".

The changes this character brings:

- Start with a box
- All static guns and grenades are now pools
- Stinger has been changed to a general rocket launcher pool with reduced cost (3 instead of 4, like the controllable launcher)

## Changelog

### 1.0.2

Box now spawns with starting equipment.
Reduced starting points by 1.

### 1.0.1

Changed suppressor token cost (4 -> 2).

### 1.0.0

Initial Release.

# Erect Steak

The name of this project is a joke that relates to the H3VR (a game about shooting hotdogs) character "Flaccid Steak".

The changes this character brings:

- Start with a box
- All static guns and grenades are now pools
- Stinger has been changed to a general rocket launcher pool with reduced cost (3 instead of 4, like the controllable launcher)
